            <h2>The Agency We Wished We Could Hire</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>dear&co was founded on a simple, frustrating question: why are so many web agencies focused on deliverables instead of results? We were tired of seeing businesses invest in beautiful, expensive websites that did nothing for their bottom line.</p>
            <p>We are a collective of strategists, designers, and engineers who see websites for what they should be: powerful, automated growth engines. We treat your business like our own, which means we're obsessed with your ROI, your customer acquisition cost, and your long-term success. We're the partners we always wished we could find.</p>

        <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
        <p class="principles-intro">These aren't just words on a wall. They are the principles that guide every decision we make, every line of code we write, and every client relationship we build.</p>
        <div class="principles-grid">
            <div class="principle-item">
                <h3>Radical Ownership</h3>
                <p>Your goals are our goals. We take full responsibility for the performance of our work, tracking metrics and making data-driven adjustments to ensure we deliver on our promises.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle-item">
                <h3>Diagnosis Before Prescription</h3>
                <p>We never start with a solution in mind. We start by deeply understanding your business, your customers, and your challenges. The right strategy can only come from a precise diagnosis.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle-item">
                <h3>Clarity is Kindness</h3>
                <p>No jargon, no buzzwords, no black-box processes. We communicate openly and transparently, ensuring you understand the "why" behind every strategic decision.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="principle-item">
                <h3>Pragmatic Craftsmanship</h3>
                <p>We are obsessed with quality, from pixel-perfect design to elegant, scalable code. But we are pragmatic—every detail must serve the ultimate goal: driving measurable growth for your business.</p>
